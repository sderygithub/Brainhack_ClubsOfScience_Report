## Brainhack Report ##

To compile this paper you will need a to have a distribution of LaTex that includes bibtex and pdflatex tools as well as Pandoc installed on your local computer. If you have a PC, I am not sure how you install latex.

On Mac:
The installation of LaTex can be easily achieved on a Mac using the [mactex package](https://tug.org/mactex/). 

For Ubuntu:
    
	sudo apt-get install texlive-full

For Redhat/CentOS/Fedora (I believe that this will work):
	
	sudo yum install texlive

The Brainhack Report is written in Markdown and then converted into LaTex using a Brainhack report template. To perform this step you will need to have Pandoc installed. This can be accomplished on a variety of operating systems using instructions from the [Installing Pandoc web page](http://pandoc.org/installing.html).

If you have make installed you can compile the paper using:
    
    make

Otherwise you will need to run the commands:
    
	pandoc -s -S -N --template brainhack-report-template.tex brainhack-report.md -o brainhack-report-formatted.tex
	pdflatex brainhack-report-formatted.tex
	bibtex brainhack-report-formatted
	pdflatex brainhack-report-formatted.tex
	pdflatex brainhack-report-formatted.tex

The multiple runs makes sure that all references are resolved. If you do not 
change the bib file you will not need to rerun the bibtex command.
